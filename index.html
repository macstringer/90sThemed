    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmZm8vNHBSU&ab_channel=haxorcat">Internet piracy was big in the 90s.</a>



<div class="widther">
  <p>
    Though I wasn't a 90s baby, I have become increasingly interested 
    in vaporwave and 90's internet culture.
  </p>
  <p>
    I live in Chapel Hill, but I grew up in Lusaka, Zambia
  
  <p>
    When did you first start using a computer?  
    I first started using a computer when I was 8 or 9, when I got to use some at school and when my dad bought one.
    Where I lived we had some very slow internet, so I used to carry around a usb drive with games I liked to play on it.
    There was a whole trading environment at school, where people would transfer games to eachothers' usb drives.
  </p>
  <p>
    What event(s) made you interested in studying computer science? 
    During high school, I was interested in poltical science and statistics. 
    I learned to program in SAS but I eventually came to enjoy the posibilities of computer science more than stats.
  </p>
  <p>
    What kinds of computers/programming languages have you used?  
    I've used SAS, Java, R, Python, HTML and Ruby, though I've forgotten most of those but Python.
  </p>
  <p>
    How do you use computers and programming on a daily basis (i.e., outside of course assignments)?  
    Working on a campaign last semester I used computer science to automate some data collection, 
    but otherwise I've used my computer to make music, edit youtube videos and all manner of other things.
  </p>
  <p>
    What is motivating you to take this course and what do you want to get out of this experience?  
    I really want to become a master of the web! The idea of making something that everyone can use or see is really exciting for me!
    I also think these skills will be valuable for me one day.
  </p>
  <p>
    How do you see yourself using programming in the future?  
    I hope to get a job in Computer Science some day, and even if I don't explicitly, CS presents so many opportunities to automate systems that it will surely be helpful.
  </p>
  <p>
    What do you think a web developer does on a daily basis? 
    I bet most of a web developer's time is spent debugging websites and problems, though I bet the feeling of finally getting a site to look and feel perfect is awesome.
  </p>
  <p>
    What kinds of skills are required to code different parts of a web site?  
    Not only do you have to have the coding skills to put everything together, but to build a good site you've also got to be able to be competent in design,
    and be able to understand how people are viewing your site, so that you can make it easy to use.

  <h3> Another big motif in vaporwave is use of japanese characters.</h3>
  <p>

世の中を　憂しとやさしと　おもへども　飛び立ちかねつ　鳥にしあらねば
Yononaka wo / Ushi to yasashi to / Omo(h)e domo / Tobitachi kanetsu / Tori ni shi arane ba
I feel the life is / sorrowful and unbearable / though / I can't flee away / since I am not a bird.
